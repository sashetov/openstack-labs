Some Openstack labs I did a while back to test single VLAN+single PHY net iface per node+on multiple nodes possibilities for networking VMs via VXLAN  created on different compute nodes
lab 4 specifically is up to that point, the the previous ones were learning attempts.
pinging was possible, but network connection would hang and I was debugging this but never got enough time to get the whole set up stable enough for use
