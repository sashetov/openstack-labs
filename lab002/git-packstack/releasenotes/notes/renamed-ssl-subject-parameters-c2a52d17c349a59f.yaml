upgrade:
  - |
    Parameters names for SSL certificates subjects have
    been changed. While old parameters names still works
    when using answers files, they will not work when
    passed with packstack cli. For users using them, they
    are required to move to new CLI parameters, see ``packstack -h``
    for details of new names.

    SSL certificates subject parameters can be used now
    both to create a new selfsigned CA certificate or
    to generate new server certificates using an existing
    CA certificate. In order to provide a more accurate
    usage description for SSL certificates subject parameters,
    they have been renamed as follows:

      * CONFIG_SELFSIGN_CACERT_SUBJECT_C is renamed to
        CONFIG_SSL_CERT_SUBJECT_C
      * CONFIG_SELFSIGN_CACERT_SUBJECT_ST is renamed to
        CONFIG_SSL_CERT_SUBJECT_ST
      * CONFIG_SELFSIGN_CACERT_SUBJECT_L is renamed to
        CONFIG_SSL_CERT_SUBJECT_L
      * CONFIG_SELFSIGN_CACERT_SUBJECT_O is renamed to
        CONFIG_SSL_CERT_SUBJECT_O
      * CONFIG_SELFSIGN_CACERT_SUBJECT_OU is renamed to
        CONFIG_SSL_CERT_SUBJECT_OU
      * CONFIG_SELFSIGN_CACERT_SUBJECT_CN is renamed to
        CONFIG_SSL_CERT_SUBJECT_CN
      * CONFIG_SELFSIGN_CACERT_SUBJECT_MAIL is renamed to
        CONFIG_SSL_CERT_SUBJECT_MAIL

    Old parameters names in answer files will still work
    but it's recomended to move to new ones.
