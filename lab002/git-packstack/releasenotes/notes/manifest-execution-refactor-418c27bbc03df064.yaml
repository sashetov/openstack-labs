features:
  - Previously, Packstack created many individual manifest files from
    smaller snippets (templates), and executed them following a certain
    order. This is sub-optimal, since it forces code duplication and goes
    against the Puppet design of running a single manifest.

    This patch refactors the manifest execution, with the following changes

    - Only 4 templates used, so max 4 Puppet executions on a host. Controller
      manifest, network node manifest, compute node manifest, and a firewall
      manifest, which is still generated on the fly for simplicity.

    - The previous snippets are now part of the Packstack Puppet module, and
      included as needed by the controller/network/compute manifests. This
      concept is similar to the one used by the puppet-openstack-integration
      project.

    - The remaining Python code is left untouched, so we can keep complete
      compatibility with previous answer files.

deprecations:
