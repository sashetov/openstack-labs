    The Tempest implementation in Packstack has been refactored and improved in
    order to be able to install, configure and run Tempest against itself.
    We have leveraged these new features to have Packstack gate patch reviews
    against integration jobs where the patch is tested automatically against a
    wide range of configuration scenarios.
features:
  - |
    Implemented test scenarios and tools to troubleshoot failed installations

  - |
    Implemented gate jobs which install Packstack and run tempest against itself

  - |
    Tempest installation and configuration has been vastly improved
