features:
  - |
    New parameter ``--os-neutron-ovs-bridges-compute`` has been introduced to
    set the OVS bridges created and configured in compute nodes when vlan or
    flat type drivers are enabled.

fixes:
  - |
    Before this patch, all defined OVS bridges were created in both network
    and compute hosts. However, in certain topologies some bridges are only
    required in network hosts.
